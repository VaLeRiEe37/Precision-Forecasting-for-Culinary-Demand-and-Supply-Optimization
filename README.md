# Precision-Forecasting-for-Culinary-Demand-and-Supply-Optimization

- Engineered an ML-based forecasting model leveraging ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) to analyze and predict demand for restaurants, grocery stores, and meal delivery services, incorporating variables like historical sales, promotions, and homepage features.
- Conducted rigorous backtesting on the models across three 20-week periods, achieving a notably low prediction error rate of 8.8%, showcasing the models' accuracy and reliability in forecasting demand.
- The implementation of these models facilitated substantial cost savings, directly contributing to an estimated $0.1 million reduction in waste and shortages per product every 20 days, cumulatively saving approximately $7 million across 77 products.
- Developed a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for real-time model adjustments and forecasting, significantly enhancing operational efficiency in inventory management and staff scheduling.
